# Analyzing International Debt Statistics

Description
------------
* A SQL project where the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries was analyzed using **_The World Bank_** dataset.
* This project aimed to answer three questions:
  * What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
  * Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
  * What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

Conclusions
------------
* The total amount of debt owed by the listed countries is around $3079734500000.
* China was determined to owe the maximum amount of debt, owing around $96218620836.
* Average debt amounts across different debt indicators were calculated. The most common indicator is "Principal repayments on external debt, long-term (AMT, current US$)", with an average debt of $5904868401.
